# Nondeterministic Finit Automat
A Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) is a machine used in computer science to recognize patterns.
It’s like a game where you follow arrows between states based on the input symbols. Unlike a normal machine, an NFA can:
Have multiple possible arrows for the same symbol.
Even move without reading any symbol (ε-transitions).
- If any possible path ends in an accepting state after reading the input, the NFA accepts it.
## Common representations of this are:
